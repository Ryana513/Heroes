## Why React?
  * All the kids are doing it
### Overall Idea behind React
  * [Project Page](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
  * Declarative
  * Component-Based
  * Learn Once, Write Anywhere (loaded term)
  * More Javascript than framework syntax
  
### From react to other libraries
  * Learning React is useful, even when moving to other frameworks
    * Vue.js
    * Angular
    * Cycle.js
    * Ember

## Intro and rundown
  * Course structure
  * Excersises and setup files
  * Building out a project, but please no more todo apps
### Starting with Tour of Git Heros, based on Angular's Popular Tour of Heros
  * [Tour of Heros](https://angular.io/tutorial)
  * It hits on a lot of good points, things used in everyday web app building. 
    1. Display an array of things
    2. Hide or show items based on conditions
    3. Edit fields/properties of item in a collection
    4. Dashboard -> Master list -> detail view. Used all the time
    5. Added network calls from Github's API for real world experience
### Course Resources
  * [Project Repo & Document]()

## Tooling and Setup
  * Create React App
  * ES2015 and lots of it
  * Babel, transpiling
  * Webpack & live reloading
  * Lots of hidden configs, which is fine for now
  * Eject app

## Loading state with onClick

## How do we update state?

## Issuses of state, it's complicated

## Redux, as a possible solution
  * Defined
  > The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.
  > The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
  > To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers.
  * From the creator [Tutorial](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)
